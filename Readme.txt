CookingTimer is a simple application which counts seconds,
up from 99 hours 59 minutes 59 seconds.

I wrote this program to learn how to handle the pulse() and
then the BPictureButton. It only beeps when it counts down
to zero. There are many rooms to expand this program.

I found a bug in BBitmap in B_GRAY1 (1 bit/pixel) mode.
As you can see, the interior of BPictureButtons would not
be updated correctly when it appears from under other
windows.

This of course is a freeware.
Have fun!
